# **YoutubeConsistentKey**

Are you tired of the incosistency of the arrow keys? Sometimes it is volume, sometimes it is seeking forward. I had enough of that so I decided to make a small extension.

*This will keep the keys consistent*
* Upward & downward arrow key for volume 5% up and down
* Left & right keys for 5 second seeking
* P to toggle between picture in picture mood

**Couldn't upload to chrome  web store due to payment.**

### *I know it is a very small code but I didn't want any bullshit. It does what it promises to do**

*Currently only works in youtube but you can change the manifest.json file for other websites*
